# Malware Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing two malware samples using a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques. The goal is to understand the behavior and impact of the malware samples in a controlled environment.

The main steps include:

`1` Setting up an isolated virtual environment.

`2` Conducting both basic and advanced static analysis:
   - Disassembling the malware
   - Observing its structure and behavior without execution

`3` Performing both basic and advanced dynamic analysis:
   - Running the malware in a controlled environment
   - Using a debugger to analyze its real-time behavior

`4` Documenting the findings in a final report, including personal insights and conclusions.

This project is based on analyzing two malware samples, specifically **Bitcoin Miner** and **Agent Tesla**.
